<h1> Who is Daniela? </h1>
    <img src="images/blue-hair.png" alt="My Picture">
<p> Hello I'm so glad you are here! My name is Daniela Arroyo and I am new to coding but extremely excited to learn. When I'm not sitting on my bed trying to learn I'm usually out with friends or just watching shows on TV.  </p>
<p> Some of my current <strong> binge </strong> worthy shows are </p>
<ul>
	<li>Rick and Morty </li>
	<li>Bobs Burgers </li>
	<li>Bojack Horseman</li>
	<li>Pretty Little Liars (I know I'm a dork)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm really interested in developing this new skill because I've always been fascinated by the idea of how technology is taking over the world. I like to think I am not extremely shy but I am at first. After that I'm kind of a dork but I'm known to be extremely caring. I do ask a lot of questions not to be "Chismosa" but I am just very curious. </p>
<p> I currently live at home with my parents. They are another reason I'm putting my mind and soul into this course. I want to be able to take care of them now, they have worked hard enough to support my family. My parents are extremely hardworking and I strive to work just as hard for them. </p>
<p>My only kids are my two dogs BonJovi and Firulais. Oh, and a cat name Cruella, whom I can no longer love due to this <strong>cruel world </strong>making me allergic to cats :(</p>
<p>Some of my other hobbies are </p>
<ul>
	<li> Running around Houston trying to catch Pokemon </li>
	<li> Realizing I have anger issues when I play Overwatch </li>
	<li> Laughing at memes </li>
	<li> Helping my mother clean houses </li>
	<li> Wrestling my pitbull to shower him </li>
	<li> Watching Youtube videos on how to cook healthy food, but never cooking </li>
	<li> Putting on colorful wigs and taking pictures </li>
	<li> Most of all I enjoy writing </li>
</ul>

<p> Before finding coding, I was working as a Vet Tech. Which made me realize even-thought I love animals doesn't mean I have the heart to take care of them when they are sick. Plus my dogs became very jealous when I would come home smelling like other dogs. I couldn't keep hurting them. I really wish I could share pictures of them but they are camera shy </p>
